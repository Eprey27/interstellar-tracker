# Global Configuration
# All updates will follow these rules unless overridden above

# Security and Stability Settings:
# - Weekly checks (not daily) for better stability
# - Staggered schedule to avoid load spikes
# - Pre-release versions ignored for stability
# - Automatic rebasing enabled for cleaner history
# - Limited concurrent PRs to avoid overwhelming maintainers
# - Custom commit messages with emojis for visual categorization
# - Auto-assigned to maintainer for immediate review

# Update Strategy:
# - NuGet: Auto-update minor/patch, manual review for major
# - Docker: Auto-update for security patches
# - GitHub Actions: Auto-update for all (least risky)

# Best Practices Applied:
# - Reviews assigned automatically
# - Labels for categorization and filtering
# - Branch naming conventions for clarity
# - Custom commit messages aligned with gitmoji standards
# - Rebase strategy for clean history
